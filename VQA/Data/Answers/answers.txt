This appears to be symptoms of yellow or stripe rust. The pustules of stripe rust, which contain yellow to orange-yellow urediospores and usually form in stripes on the leaves.
Infection can occur at any stage of plant growth. The present image shows disease infection at tillering stage with around 20-30% disease severity. 
The stripe or yellow rust is caused by a fungus, Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici for stripe rust. Cool and humid weather generally favours the disease development.


 
The stripe or yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici Erikss.) prefers lower temperature (20°C) and dominates in cooler parts.

Yes, adjacent crops are sure to be affected as this infection spreads through wind,
    
Brown Rust


    
Infection can occur at any stage of plant growth. The present image shows disease infection at tillering stage with around 20% in severity




    
Stem rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia graminis tririci. 




    
Warm and hot temperature 25-30° C




    
The Yield will be impacted it will be lesser than expected.


    
Probably the month of Mid March to April


    
The stem or Black rust symptom formation without any hypertensive response represent high virulence of the rust. 




    
It might reduce the grain quality and yield.




    
Larger pustules may suggest a more progressed infection, as the fungus has had additional time to grow.




 
Usually, pathogen myceliun spreads throughout the plant system 




 
The angle of light and the intensity of light surely effect the visual presence of the rust present. It sometimes makes it more saturated or sometime more blackish


 
Bright reddish to black spores eruption from leaf surface should be there
